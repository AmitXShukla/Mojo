## About Author

I'm Amit Shukla, and I specialize in training neural networks for finance supply chain analysis, enabling them to identify data patterns and make accurate predictions.
During the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I successfully trained GL and Supply Chain neural networks to anticipate supply chain shortages. The valuable insights gained from this effort have significantly influenced the content of this book.

Despite my ability to devise an innovative solution, I couldn't transition my AI models from research to production during the peak of the pandemic. My efforts to transform my work into a scalable solution capable of handling petabytes of data were hindered by the challenges of optimizing and fine-tuning my code for parallelization and multi-threaded execution.

Additionally, I faced difficulties in securing the necessary high-performance GPU hardware, as such resources were monopolized by owners of expensive equipment.

Subsequently, I discovered Modular and Mojo. This book represents my endeavor to rewrite and transition my code to the Modular and Mojo programming languages, with the aim of ensuring that I am well-prepared for any future pandemics.

My goal is to enable the seamless deployment of my research code into production, without the concerns of exorbitant hardware expenses and the costs associated with IT fine-tuning and optimization.

### Objective

We'll gain expertise in the essential techniques of employing the Mojo Programming language to handle real-life scenarios. This knowledge is vital for the preparation of finance and supply chain data for advanced analytics, visualization, and predictive modeling through neural networks, machine learning models, training, testing and deployment.

### Subject

It's important to note that this particular series will concentrate solely on using Mojo as one AI language to solve a real life AI problem.

### Following

However, in future installments, we will explore Data Analytics and delve into the realm of machine learning for predictive analytics to final AI deployment into production.

Thank you for joining me, and I'm excited to embark on this educational journey together.
