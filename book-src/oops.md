## Structures

You can build high-level abstractions for types (or “objects”) in a struct.

A struct in Mojo is similar to a class in Python: they both support methods, fields, operator overloading, decorators for metaprogramming, etc.

However, Mojo structs are completely static—they are bound at compile-time, so they do not allow dynamic dispatch or any runtime changes to the structure. (Mojo will also support classes in the future.)
