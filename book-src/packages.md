# Module and Packages

In this chapter, we'll focus solely on Mojo's modules and packages, which are quite different from those in Python.

Python, a mature and comprehensive programming language, has evolved into a prominent language for Data Science and AI. This is largely due to its robust module and package system. Python's popularity has soared as community developers have contributed extensively through packages and modules.

Similarly, I believe Mojo will adopt a robust package management system over time, allowing experienced community developers to contribute and enhance the language's success.
